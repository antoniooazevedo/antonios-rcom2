# Part 2 Experiment 2

## Step 1
Follow the steps from 2-1 document to configure `tux62` and register IP and MAC addresses

**ifconfig eth0 up**<br>
**ifconfig eth0 172.16.Y1.1/24** 

Connect and reset the switch's configuration before starting
## Step 2
Add the bridges interfaces to the switch terminal by typing 
- **/interface bridge add name=bridge60 && ...name=bridge61**

## Step 3
To remove the ports where `tuxY2/3/4` are connected to the default bridge, analyze the switch's connections from tux62 63 and 64 to the switch ports, and use the number of the ports in the command 
- **/interface bridge port remove [find interface=ether`num`]** (different commands for each ether num)

Then, add the ports to our created bridges, using the command 
- **/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge60 interface=ether`num` and ... bridge=bridge61**, where:
  - tux63 and tux64 connect to bridge60 
  - tux62 to bridge 61

Verify the connections using `/interface bridge port print` (scroll to the bottom)

## Step 4
To capture the port, open wireshark and capture the port to which tux63 is connected to
- change to tux63 and capture eth0

Then ping tux64 and tux62, then stop the capture and save the log.
- The pings to tux64 should work fine, while the pings to tux62 should not get a response back

## Step 5
Now, start the capture on all the workstations and then ping broadcast from tux63 with `ping -b 172.16.60.255`

After waiting a few seconds, stop the captures and save all three logs
- Same scenario, pings from 63 should reach 64, but not 62

## Step 6
Now in tux62 broadcast using `ping b 172.16.61.255`
- Should only appear in 62, not in 63 and 64
